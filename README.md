## 1. World Happiness Classification
### Description
What makes the citizens of one country more happy than the citizens of other countries? Do variables measuring perceptions of corruption, GDP, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, or social support associate with a country's happiness ranking? Let's use the United Nation's World Happiness Rankings country level data to experiment with models that predict happiness rankings well.
## 2. Covid x ray classification
### Description
Predict whether a person contracted Covid, Pneumonia or neither given their x-rays images of lungs
#### Data
The data contains x-rays images for 3616 people diagnosed with Covid, 1345 people diagnosed with pneumonia, and 10192 normal people without Covid or Pneumonia

With such a model, it potentially helps:
- Early detection and treatment: A predictive model could help in the early detection of COVID-19, pneumonia, and other respiratory illnesses, allowing for prompt treatment and preventing the spread of disease.
- Screening precision: A predictive model with goog predictive power can be used for screening purposes to identify individuals who may have COVID-19 or pneumonia and require further evaluation.
- Misdiagnosis reduction: A predictive model with goog predictive power can add to the disagnosis toolkit that help differentiate between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia, which could lead to better disease management and outcomes

At the same time, multiple groups of individuals could potentially be benefited by it:
- Healthcare providers could be assited in making more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions
- Patients with such illness could be detected and treated on the timely basis
- Researchers could use it to study population with Covid or Pneumonia against normal population to optimize future prevention and treatment strategies
